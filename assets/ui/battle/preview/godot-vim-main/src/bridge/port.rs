//! `TextEditorPort` — abstraction over Godot's CodeEdit for testability.
//!
//! Trait hierarchy:
//!
//! - **`TextEditorPort`** (33 methods) — core text editing (required).
//! - **`FoldCapable`** (5 methods, default no-ops) — code folding.
//! - **`IdeCapable`** (2 methods, default no-ops) — autocomplete/hints.
//! - **`NavigationCapable`** (2 methods, default no-ops) — go-to-definition, hover docs.
//!
//! Production: `CodeEditPort` (in `port_impl.rs`) implements all four.
//! Tests: `MockTextEdit` implements `TextEditorPort`; extension traits
//! use their default no-op bodies.
